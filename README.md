DefMemo
=======

A simple memoization macro (defmemo) for Elixir.

I'm still learning Elixir and have a long way to go so I'm sure that this could
be better implemented. I had come across a Gist from Gustavo Brunoro that 
looked to cover want I wanted and have quickly updated it to Elixir 1.x while 
also making sure that it doesn't memoize the results from identical signatures
but different modules.
